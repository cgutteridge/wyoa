Although he is not tall, the man is good looking. His expression, however, is ugly. He is arguing in whispers at a table in the Ventnor Exchange. He is clearly English, but it's harder to decide the accent of the woman opposite.
Whatever they are arguing about seems to have shaken both of them and she walks out. He looks like he is about to call after her, but his phone rings. Without checking who's calling, he answers and asks "did you find it?". He presses his hand over the phone struggling to hear over the noise of other customers. In frustration he heads outside.
CHOICE: Did they find it? 
If no, walk up to the church.
If yes, walk down to the corner.

He catches up with her putting away the phone. She is waiting by the churchyard.
"Did they find it yet?"
"No, not yet. Why were you staring at that old gravestone? Someone you knew?"
"Of course not, but..."
"You were thinking about what happened again. It wasn't your fault."
"No, it was your's". Her words are cruel, but there's no malice in her delivery.
CHOICE: He either storms off down Hambrough road or crosses the road to stare out at the ocean.

He catches up with her, putting away the phone. She is staring up at the clock, comparing the time to her vintage watch.
"Did he find it?" she asks, "we don't have much time."
He waits a beat, before nodding.
"Is there are problem?"
"Not exactly...", he's stalling for time to compose his response. "It's not... not what you were expecting."
"This is no time to be coy. Come on, you can explain on the way."

LL:  50.59386,-1.21264
SIZE: 15
CONTENT:  
A rumble comes from back the way they've been walking, and a noisy moterbike grumbles past, followed by another and another. There are a real mixture flowing past. Some are crisp and modern. Some are vintage. The same thing is true of their riders - some of the older bearded chaps with well worn leathers, but now and then are less "scene" men, and a few women, usally riding the newer bikes.

The man has stopped at the gate.
"I'm not sure I can do this"
"They were my cousin. It's family for me." she says
"...and my friend."
"Come on, we have to."
At this moment, his phone buzzes and he looks at the screen.
"Oh, thank god, they found it.

CONTENT:  
The park is full of the bikers you saw earlier, a long line of bikes is parked on the road outside the park. Music is coming from the band stand. You've heard this band before, they're great. This is just the kind of event you like to go to. You feel at home.
The man goes up and talks to a chap with a laptop fiddling with some screens next to the bandstand. He hands over his phone and they fiddle around with files for a little while. Then he walks back to her.
"Sorted?"
"Yup"
"OK, lets take a step back and see how it looks."

"I lied earlier" she says, "it wasn't your fault for giving them your old bike, it was the idiot who hit them. I just say dumb stuff when I'm upset".
The digital screens around the bandstand all show the picture of the three of you the day he gave you the bike. You look so happy.
"Do you ever pretend they are still here with us, in spirit?"
"That would be nice", he says, staring right through you, "but no. Dead is dead."
"But you're glad you came?"
"Yeah... goodbye mate."

He storms off saying "I just want to be left alone".
He stops in the middle of the road, a wave of timeless vertigo passing over him.
It passes like a fruit machine with each reel clicking into place, leaving him right here right now. He looks up at the houses lining the street. All those windows, the lovers, the travelers, the lost. What stories could they tell?

CONTENT:
He arrives at some ubiquitous seaside benches. Looking out across the harbour and the bay, he thinks about what weary people had rested here after climing up from the beach, from the old pier which smells of tar on the old timbers the coal smoke from the steam boat moored up alongside. Did any of them sit here and wonder what future traveller would be looking back contemplating them? Will some future traveler look back and think about the travelers of today
He blinks and finds himself in the present again. Is that her walking down the hill he can see?

CHOICE: He either follows her to the Winter Gardens or watches her from a distance down the steps.

CONTENT: His plan was to maintain a distance, hide in the bushes and watch from his hidden view point but he quickly became preoccupied with beating his way through the bushes. Where did this path lead he wondered? Would there even be anywhere to sit at the end. By the time he got there and turned around to see if he could spot her she has already locked on to him with her uncanny counterespionage abilities. She stands hand on hips halfway down the cascades walkway. He sheepishly makes his way down to her.

She looks worried and thinks for a moment... "Did they send you a location? How far?"
"Only a few hundred metres... but moving."
"Well let's move!" she says. 
"Hold on", I'm just getting the location on a map..." 
He shows her a map on his phone screen. It's on a patch of grass over there.. or at least it was five minutes ago."
"Finally", she says running in the direction indicated by his map.

"I can't see it."
She pulls out her phone. It's screen seems to project images several inches above and below it's surface. It's showing the immediate area in 3D, complete with tiny versions of the couple. indecipherable symbols overlay the model, blinking on and off.
"Holy crap!" he says, unable to resist the lure of new tech.
"Down boy. This ain't the time... Damn, it's too vague to get a lock."

"Yeah, it's never easy is it?"
"I wouldn't know... I wish we'd had more time."
"Well, them's the breaks," she says, and tosses him her phone "You like this so much, keep it."
While he's distracted by the flying anachronism she braces herself and takes a running jump at the glimmer. By the time he looks up she's gone.

CONTENT:
His mood lightens as he walks back down the lane, sometimes you just have to let go of your mistakes and move on. He stops, a bar of music drifting on the wind catches his ear. Downhill, she would have gone downhill and found some music. He feels he is back on the right track.

SIZE: 15
CONTENT:
As he reaches the building called The Winter Gardens, he recalls a conversation he'd had where somebody told him that Rod Steward had played there once. He imagines all those teenage boys and girls, with the cheesy overpowering 70's cologne and the old style lipstick like red Vaseline all sticky and smeary. At some point in the night Rod would have played "if you think I'm sexy", people danced, cigarettes in hand, warm pints of bitter. Somebody kissed their crush for the first time, somebody walked home alone crushed. 
He realises he has stopped in the middle of the path like an idiot lost in time again. She is leaning against the railings watching him. As their eyes met she turns and goes on down the walkway with a smirking shake of the head. He follows her down.

He reaches the shelter to find her spinning around on the poles supporting the roof miming acrobatics. She does a full 360 degree spin of one pole only to let go at just the right point so that she carried on to the other pole where she would grab on and do another 360 degree spin. 
"Are you OK?" he says. 
She plops herself on the bench, saying "yeah, I'm fine" in her odd accent "are you over yourself?" she adds, raising an eyebrow. 
"You know what this place is called?" he asks, looking at the map on his phone trying to avoid her question. 
"Rene Howe Walk" he informs her. 
"Who the hell is she?" the girl asks, 
"I'm not sure" comes the reply. 
They both take a moment to prod their devices, trying to find out who this Rene Howe might be. 
"Apparently he was a minor footballer back in the beginning of the 21st century" she said "that's now" he said "and I got a feeling this thing is too old to be named after him". 
"Hey, it says here that it's impossible to touch both of those poles simultaneously" she interjects.
Shortly after, they walk on down Rene Howe walk rubbing their near dislocated shoulders laughing.

CONTENT: They arrive at the bottom of the walkway, they can hear the sound of music now, the chattering of voices. At the end of the railings is an odd stone structure, "what is that?" she asks. 
They circle it reading the inscription and touching the fittings. "I guess it's for people who can't afford to drink the beer" she says and they walk on. 
<img src='fountain.jpg' />
CHOICE: To take one last diversion before following the sound of music head out to the end of the sea wall. Otherwise carry on up to the bandstand.

SIZE: 15
CONTENT: They walk out along the harbour wall, the sounds of the town now diminishing behind them. As they reach the end they look out to sea, distant ships pass on the horizon. The sea swells, birds wheel and squawk overhead. "It's funny how you think of towns growing slowly over time, civilisation slowly but inevitably moving forward.". 
She looks at him as he stared back at the town with unfocused eyes. "In ancient times they used to think time was cyclic, that the seasons would come and go, empires would rise and fall but not true progress would be made. Now people think that time will see a ceaseless progression, growth, development, expansion" he carried on distantly. "If only they knew" she said in her peculiar accent with not a hint of sadness, more resentment.
They stand in silence for a moment longer then she says "come on, as long as we are here I need a drink."

CONTENT: They flash their wristbands, walk past the door staff and up the stairs. Music playing, colourful lights of the bar, peopling mingling and enjoying themselves. "when in Rome" she said looking at him though a lock of hair half covering her face and grinned. "So this is where we ended up then, doesn't seem like anything out of the ordinary." he said, checking his wallet and propping up the bar. "You should know by now", she said "it's not where you end up, it's what happens along the way".
